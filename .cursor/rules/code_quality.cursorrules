# Code Quality Guidelines

## Code Quality Principles
- Use lint rules with flutter_lints package
- Keep functions small and focused (under 30 lines)
- Apply SOLID principles throughout the codebase
- Use meaningful naming for classes, methods, and variables
- Document public APIs and complex logic
- Implement proper null safety
- Use value objects for domain-specific types

## SOLID Principles
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each class should have one reason to change
- **Open/Closed Principle**: Open for extension, closed for modification
- **Liskov Substitution Principle**: Objects should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes
- **Interface Segregation Principle**: Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface
- **Dependency Inversion Principle**: Depend on abstractions, not concretions

## Code Organization
- Structure files: exported widget, subwidgets, helpers, static content, types
- One export per file
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError)
- Group related functionality together
- Separate concerns appropriately
- Use consistent file and folder naming conventions

## Naming Conventions
- Use PascalCase for classes and enums
- Use camelCase for variables, functions, and methods
- Use underscores_case for file and directory names
- Use UPPERCASE for environment variables and constants
- Start each function with a verb
- Use verbs for boolean variables (e.g., isLoading, hasError, canDelete)
- Use complete words instead of abbreviations
- Use meaningful and descriptive names

## Function Design
- Write short functions with a single purpose (less than 20 instructions)
- Don't leave blank lines within a function
- Use arrow syntax for simple functions and methods
- Prefer expression bodies for one-line getters and setters
- Use default parameter values instead of checking for null
- Return early to reduce nesting
- Use higher-order functions when appropriate

## Class Design
- Write small classes with a single purpose
- Less than 200 instructions per class
- Less than 10 public methods per class
- Less than 10 properties per class
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Use proper encapsulation
- Implement interfaces to define contracts

## Data Management
- Don't abuse primitive types - encapsulate data in composite types
- Prefer immutability for data
- Use readonly for data that doesn't change
- Use as const for literals that don't change
- Avoid data validations in functions - use classes with internal validation
- Use value objects for domain-specific validation

## Documentation Standards
- Document complex logic and non-obvious code decisions
- Use clear and concise comments
- Document public APIs thoroughly
- Use Turkish comments to explain code (as per requirements)
- Keep documentation up to date with code changes
- Use meaningful commit messages
- Document architectural decisions

## Error Handling Quality
- Handle errors at the appropriate layer
- Use functional error handling patterns (Either)
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Implement proper error recovery mechanisms
- Don't ignore exceptions or errors
- Log errors with appropriate context

## Code Formatting
- Use trailing commas for better formatting and diffs
- Keep lines no longer than 80 characters
- Add commas before closing brackets for multi-parameter functions
- Use consistent indentation
- Follow Dart formatting conventions
- Use automated formatting tools

## Testing Quality
- Write testable code
- Use dependency injection for better testability
- Keep tests simple and focused
- Test edge cases and error scenarios
- Use meaningful test names
- Keep test code clean and maintainable

## Code Review Standards
- Review for adherence to these guidelines
- Check for proper error handling
- Verify test coverage for new code
- Ensure documentation is adequate
- Look for potential performance issues
- Verify security considerations

## Refactoring Guidelines
- Refactor when code becomes hard to understand
- Extract methods when functions become too long
- Extract classes when responsibilities become unclear
- Remove code duplication
- Simplify complex conditional logic
- Improve naming when it becomes unclear

## Quality Metrics
- Maintain high test coverage (especially for domain layer)
- Monitor code complexity metrics
- Track code duplication
- Measure build and test execution times
- Monitor dependency health and updates
- Use static analysis tools

## Best Practices
- Use const constructors where possible
- Leverage Freezed for immutable state classes
- Use proper type annotations
- Avoid magic numbers and strings - use constants
- Implement proper resource disposal
- Use appropriate design patterns
- Follow Flutter and Dart best practices
- Keep dependencies up to date

## Code Smells to Avoid
- Long parameter lists
- Large classes and methods
- Deep nesting
- Code duplication
- Magic numbers and strings
- Poor naming
- Tight coupling
- God objects
- Feature envy
- Inappropriate intimacy
