## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### Firebase Collections Schema
```
users/{userId}/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ courses/           # User's personal courses
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ eventInteractions/ # User's event likes, joins, shares
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ myEvents/         # User's joined events
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ followedClubs/    # User's followed clubs

events/{eventId}/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ comments/         # Event comments and replies
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ (event data)      # Event details and counters

clubs/{clubId}/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ (club data)       # Club information and followers
```
