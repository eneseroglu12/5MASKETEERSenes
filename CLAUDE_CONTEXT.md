## 📋 Pending Tasks

### Test Complete User-Specific Experience (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Goal**: Comprehensive testing of all user-specific features

**Testing Areas**:
- User course management end-to-end
- Event interactions (like, join, share, comment)
- Club following workflow
- Real-time counter updates
- Data persistence and sync
- Error handling and edge cases

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Firebase Collections Schema
```
users/{userId}/
├── courses/           # User's personal courses
├── eventInteractions/ # User's event likes, joins, shares
├── myEvents/         # User's joined events
└── followedClubs/    # User's followed clubs

events/{eventId}/
├── comments/         # Event comments and replies
└── (event data)      # Event details and counters

clubs/{clubId}/
└── (club data)       # Club information and followers
```

### Service Architecture
- **Singleton Pattern**: All services use singleton pattern for consistency
- **Stream-Based**: Real-time updates using Firebase snapshots
- **Cache Management**: Smart caching with expiration timers
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user feedback
- **Memory Management**: Proper subscription disposal and cleanup

### Key Design Patterns
1. **Service Layer Pattern**: Clear separation of business logic
2. **Repository Pattern**: Abstracted data access
3. **Observer Pattern**: Real-time UI updates via streams
4. **Factory Pattern**: Model creation from Firebase data

## 🚀 Next Steps Guidance

When continuing this project, focus on:

1. **Complete Comments System**: 
   - Build comment UI components
   - Integrate real-time comment streams
   - Add comment moderation features

2. **Comprehensive Testing**:
   - Test all user workflows end-to-end
   - Verify real-time features work correctly
   - Check data consistency and error handling

3. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Optimize stream subscriptions
   - Implement efficient caching strategies
   - Monitor Firebase usage and costs

4. **User Experience Enhancements**:
   - Add loading states and animations
   - Implement offline capabilities
   - Add push notifications

## 🛠️ Technical Stack
