# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is **MedipolApp** - a Flutter mobile application for Medipol University students and staff. The app provides university services including authentication, announcements, cafeteria menus, academic calendar, campus maps, and QR access functionality.

#Standard Workflow
1. First think through the problem, read the codebase for relevant files, and write a plan to tasks/todo.md.
2. The plan should have a list of todo items that you can check off as you complete them
3. Before you begin working, check in with me and I will verify the plan.
4. Then, begin working on the todo items, marking them as complete as you go.
5. Please every step of the way just give me a high level explanation of what changes you made
6. Make every task and code change you do as simple as possible. We want to avoid making any massive or complex changes. Every change should impact as little code as possible. Everything is about simplicity.
7. Finally, update the review section in CLAUDE.md file with a summary of the changes you made and any other relevant information.

### Flutter Commands
```bash
# Install dependencies
flutter pub get

# Run the app in development mode

## Review Section

### Campus Map Loading Issue Fix (2025-01-19)

**Problem:** Google Maps failed to load on initial screen load and retry button became broken.

**Root Cause Analysis (Updated):**
- **Missing asset file**: `assets/map_styles/dark_map_style.json` didn't exist, causing initialization failure
- **Timeout not cancelled**: Timer continued running even after retry, causing double timeouts
- **State management issues**: Multiple setState calls and improper timer cleanup
- **Asset dependency**: Map initialization failed due to missing optional dark theme file

**Solution Implemented (Corrected):**
1. **Fixed missing asset handling** - Made dark map style optional, graceful fallback to default
2. **Proper timeout management** - Added Timer reference with proper cancellation
3. **Simplified retry logic** - Removed duplicate setState calls
4. **Added dispose method** - Proper cleanup of timer resources
5. **Enhanced error handling** - Separated asset loading from map initialization
6. **Reduced timeout** to 10 seconds for better UX

**Key Changes:**
- `campus_map_screen.dart:27` - Added Timer reference for proper cleanup
- `campus_map_screen.dart:36-40` - Added dispose method
- `campus_map_screen.dart:42-78` - Rebuilt `_initializeMap()` with proper timer management
- `campus_map_screen.dart:65-78` - Separated `_loadDarkMapStyle()` method
- `campus_map_screen.dart:694-697` - Simplified retry button logic
- `campus_map_screen.dart:608-609` - Cancel timer on successful map creation

**Result:** Map should now load successfully on first attempt without dependency on missing asset files.

### New Post and Club Creation Feature Implementation (2025-01-22)

**Task:** Implement user ability to create new event posts and clubs via FloatingActionButton in the upcoming events screen.

**Implementation Completed:**

**1. Dialog System:**
- Created `AddEventDialog` (`lib/widgets/dialogs/add_event_dialog.dart`) - Comprehensive event creation form
- Created `AddClubDialog` (`lib/widgets/dialogs/add_club_dialog.dart`) - Complete club registration form
- Both dialogs feature responsive UI, form validation, and proper error handling

**2. Service Extensions:**
- Extended `UserEventsService` with `createEvent()`, `updateEvent()`, `deleteEvent()` methods
- Extended `UserClubFollowingService` with `createClub()`, `updateClub()`, `deleteClub()` methods  
- Added `getEventById()` method for event management operations
- Proper Firebase integration with Firestore document management

**3. UI Integration:**
- Updated `upcoming_events_screen.dart` with new FloatingActionButton selection menu
- Implemented bottom sheet with options for creating events or clubs
- Integrated event comments functionality with `EventCommentsScreen`
- Added proper refresh logic after successful creation

**Key Features:**
- **Event Creation**: Title, description, date/time, location, capacity, registration settings, event types
- **Club Creation**: Name, description, categories, academic info, contact details, social media, visual branding
- **Real-time Integration**: New posts immediately appear in feeds after creation
- **User Authentication**: Proper user verification and ownership management
- **Form Validation**: Comprehensive input validation with Turkish localization
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages and loading states

**Technical Details:**
- Firebase Firestore integration for data persistence
- Proper model serialization with JSON annotations
- Auth service integration for user context
- Cache management for optimal performance
- Material Design UI components with app theming

**Files Modified:**
- `lib/screens/upcoming_events_screen.dart` - FloatingActionButton and dialog integration
- `lib/services/user_events_service.dart` - Event CRUD operations
- `lib/services/user_club_following_service.dart` - Club CRUD operations  
- `lib/widgets/dialogs/add_event_dialog.dart` - Event creation UI
- `lib/widgets/dialogs/add_club_dialog.dart` - Club creation UI

**Result:** Users can now successfully create events and clubs directly from the app, completing the user-specific backend transformation. The feature integrates seamlessly with the existing real-time commenting and interaction systems.

### Microsoft Graph API Avatar Fetching Temporary Disable (2025-01-22)

**Issue:** Comment screen was generating hundreds of HTTP 401 errors when trying to fetch user profile photos from Microsoft Graph API (`https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/photo/$value`).

**Solution Applied:**
- **Temporarily disabled** Microsoft Graph API photo fetching in `user_model.dart:188-194`
- Modified `profilePhotoUrl` getter to return `null` instead of Graph API URL
- **Preserved all Microsoft OAuth functionality** - only disabled the photo fetching aspect
- **Fallback avatar system** already in place shows user initials when no photo available

**Technical Details:**
- Comment system (`event_comment_item.dart`) and input widget (`comment_input_widget.dart`) already handle null avatars gracefully
- Shows first letter of user's displayName in colored circle when `authorAvatar` is null
- No visual functionality lost - users still get personalized avatars with their initials
- Microsoft OAuth authentication remains fully functional for other features

**Files Modified:**
- `lib/models/user_model.dart:191-193` - Disabled Graph API photo URL, return null instead

**Result:** Comment screen now works without HTTP 401 errors while maintaining all visual and functional aspects. Microsoft OAuth authentication preserved for future use.

### Join Button Timestamp Conversion Fix (2025-01-22)

**Issue:** Users encountered "type 'Timestamp' is not a subtype of type 'DateTime'" error when clicking join button on events.

**Root Cause:** Firebase Firestore returns Timestamp objects for datetime fields, but UserMyEvent model expected DateTime objects directly.

**Solution Applied:**
- Fixed Firebase Timestamp to DateTime conversion in `user_events_service.dart:361-363`
- Added explicit casting: `(eventData['startDateTime'] as Timestamp).toDate()`
- Applied same fix for `eventEndDate` field

**Technical Details:**
- Error occurred in `toggleEventJoin()` method when creating UserMyEvent objects
- Firebase Timestamp objects need `.toDate()` conversion to DateTime
- Proper type casting ensures compatibility with model requirements

**Files Modified:**
- `lib/services/user_events_service.dart:361-363` - Added Timestamp to DateTime conversion

**Result:** Join button now works correctly without type conversion errors. Users can successfully join/leave events.

### CustomReminders Serialization Fix (2025-01-22)

**Issue:** Users encountered "Invalid argument: Instance of 'CustomReminders'" error when clicking join button on events.

**Root Cause:** The `CustomReminders` object in `UserMyEvent` was not being properly serialized to Firestore-compatible format, causing Firebase to reject the complex object.

**Solution Applied:**
- Enhanced `UserMyEvent.toFirestoreData()` method to explicitly serialize `CustomReminders` to JSON
- Added proper deserialization handling in `UserMyEvent.fromFirestoreData()` method
- Ensured `CustomReminders` objects are converted to Map format before Firestore storage

**Technical Details:**
- Error occurred when creating `UserMyEvent` objects during join operations
- Firebase Firestore requires complex nested objects to be serialized as Maps
- Added explicit `customReminders.toJson()` conversion in serialization
- Added validation for proper Map format during deserialization

**Files Modified:**
- `lib/models/user_event_models.dart:613` - Enhanced toFirestoreData() with explicit CustomReminders serialization
- `lib/models/user_event_models.dart:600-603` - Added CustomReminders validation in fromFirestoreData()

**Result:** Join button now works correctly without CustomReminders serialization errors. Users can successfully join/leave events with proper reminder settings.

### Remember Me Feature Implementation (2025-01-22)

**Feature Added:** Complete "Remember Me" functionality allowing users to skip login on subsequent app launches.

**Implementation Details:**
- **Extended SecureStorageService**: Added secure credential storage with `storeRememberedCredentials()` and auto-login detection
- **Enhanced Login Screen**: Added "Beni hatırla" checkbox with auto-fill functionality
- **Auto-Login on Startup**: Modified `InitialLoadingScreen` to automatically log in users with valid stored credentials
- **Secure Logout**: Updated `AuthenticationProvider.signOut()` to clear remember me data on logout

**Key Features:**
- 🔐 **Secure Storage**: Credentials encrypted using Flutter Secure Storage
- ⚡ **Auto-Login**: Seamless login without user interaction
- 🎯 **Smart UI**: Auto-fills login form with remembered credentials
- 🛡️ **Security**: Automatic cleanup of invalid credentials and explicit logout clearing

**Technical Architecture:**
- `SecureStorageService` extended with remember me methods
- `InitialLoadingScreen` enhanced with auto-login logic  
- `LoginScreen` updated with remember me checkbox and credential loading
- `AuthenticationProvider` integrated with remember me cleanup on logout

**User Experience:**
- Check "Beni hatırla" on first login → App remembers credentials securely
- Next app launch → Automatic login to home screen (no user interaction needed)
- Manual logout → All remember me data cleared for security
- Invalid credentials → Automatic cleanup and fallback to manual login

**Files Modified:**
- `lib/services/secure_storage_service.dart` - Added remember me storage methods
- `lib/screens/login_screen.dart` - Added remember me checkbox and auto-fill
- `lib/screens/initial_loading_screen.dart` - Added auto-login functionality
- `lib/providers/authentication_provider.dart` - Added remember me cleanup on logout

**Result:** Users can now enjoy seamless login experience while maintaining enterprise-level security standards.
